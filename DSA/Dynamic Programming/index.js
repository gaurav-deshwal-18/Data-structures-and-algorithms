// Dynamic Programming:

// Optimal Substructure and Overlapping Subproblems:
// - Problems that can be broken down into smaller overlapping subproblems with optimal solutions.

// Memoization and Tabulation:
// - Techniques to store and reuse solutions of subproblems, either through caching or building a table.

// Steps to Solve Problems using DP:
// 1. Identify Overlapping Subproblems.
// 2. Formulate a Recurrence Relation.
// 3. Implement Memoization or Tabulation.
// 4. Build Solution Bottom-Up or Top-Down.

// Common Problems Solved Using DP:
// - Fibonacci Series: Efficient computation using memoization or tabulation.
// - Longest Common Subsequence (LCS): Finding the longest common subsequence.
// - Knapsack Problem: Maximizing total value within a knapsack's capacity.
// - Shortest/Longest Path Problems: Finding optimal paths in graphs.
// - Edit Distance: Minimum operations to convert one string to another.

// Benefits of Dynamic Programming:
// - Efficiency Improvement: Avoiding redundant calculations.
// - Optimal Solutions: Systematically evaluating all subproblems for best solutions.
// - Applicability: Wide application across various problem domains.

// Dynamic programming is a powerful algorithmic technique utilized across multiple disciplines, offering efficient solutions to problems with optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.
