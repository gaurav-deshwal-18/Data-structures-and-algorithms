// Aakash is a member of Ninja club. He has a weird family structure. Every male member (M) gives birth to a male child first and then a female child, whereas every female (F) member gives birth to a female child first and then to a male child. Aakash analyses this pattern and wants to know what will be the Kth child in his Nth generation. Can you help him?

// A sample generation tree is shown, where ‘M’ denotes the male member and ‘F’ denotes the female member.
