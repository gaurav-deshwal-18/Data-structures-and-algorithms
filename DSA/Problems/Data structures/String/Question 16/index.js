// Problem statement

// You have been given an integer 'N'. Your task is to generate and return all binary strings of length 'N' such that there are no consecutive 1's in the string.

// A binary string is that string which contains only ‘0’ and ‘1’.

// For Example:

// Let ‘N'=3, hence the length of the binary string would be 3.

// We can have the following binary strings with no consecutive 1s:
// 000 001 010 100 101
