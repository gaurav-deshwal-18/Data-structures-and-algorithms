// You have been given an Encrypted String where repetitions of substrings are represented as substring followed by the count of substrings.

// Example: String "aabbbcdcdcd" will be encrypted as "a2b3cd3".

// You need to find the 'K'th character of Decrypted String. Decrypted String would have 1-based indexing.

// Note :

// Input string will always be lowercase characters without any spaces.

// If the count of a substring is 1 then also it will be followed by Integer '1'.
// Example: "aabcdee" will be Encrypted as "a2bcd1e2"
// This means it's guaranteed that each substring is followed by some Integer.

// Also, the frequency of encrypted substring can be of more than one digit. For example, in "ab12c3", ab is repeated 12 times. No leading 0 is present in the frequency of substring.

// The frequency of a repeated substring can also be in parts.
// Example: "aaaabbbb" can also have "a2a2b3b1" as Encrypted String.
