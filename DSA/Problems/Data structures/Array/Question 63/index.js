// Problem statement

// You have been given an array/list 'ARR' consisting of 'N' integers. Your task is to find the majority element in the array. If there is no majority element present, print -1.
// Note:

// A majority element is an element that occurs more than floor('N' / 2) times in the array.

// Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
// Constraints:

// 1 <= T <= 100
// 1 <= N <= 5 * 10^3
// -10^5 <= ARR[i] <= 10^5

// Where 'ARR[i]' denotes the element at the 'i'th index in the array/list 'ARR'.

// Time limit: 1 sec
