// A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges
// A tree is a non-linear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks
// and queues which are linear data structures.
// In linear data structures, the time required to search is proportional to the
// size of the data set Trees however, owing to the nonlinear nature allow quicker
// and easier access to the data
